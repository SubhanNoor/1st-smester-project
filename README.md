The character move with (A,D) keys and space for jump.
The game is all about the unexpected hurdle for the user maybe in some levles the block is empty but it show you the block is filled,button trigger some hurdles,hurdles may be kill you befoore touching you so its all unexpected but intresting to play and may be your moving keys will be inverted.I hope you will enjoy it.
Before playing setup SFML lib in the IDE and download all the assets and set their path and if uou download exe then must downlaod .dll files if uou don't have.
Thank You.

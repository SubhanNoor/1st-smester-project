Game Description

The character moves using the A and D keys, and Space for jumping.

This game revolves around unexpected hurdles, offering players a thrilling and unpredictable experience. In some levels, blocks may appear filled but are actually empty. Buttons can trigger traps or obstacles, and some hurdles may eliminate you even before you touch them. To add to the excitement, your movement keys might even get inverted!

Inspired by the game Levil Devil, this game is designed to surprise and challenge players at every turn. I hope you find it both fun and engaging!
